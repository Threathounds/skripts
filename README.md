single-character-xor.py: Bruteforces the given ciphertext for single-character XOR encoding

http-pwd.sh: attempts to grab plaintext passwords sent over HTTP in a PCAP file

SimpleDecoder: a script to test for base16, base32, base64 and Ascii85 encoding

revshell_gen.sh: generate a Bash reverse TCP shell
